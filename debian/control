Description: development files for opm-models
 opm-models is an simulation framework which is primary focused on fully implicit
 models for flow and transport in porous media. Its main objectives
 are to provide a easily usable, well maintainable, high performance
 framework which is capable of capturing all macro-scale scenarios
 relevant for academic research and industrial applications involving
 flow and transport processes in porous media.
